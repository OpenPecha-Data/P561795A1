81. With their lotus-like hands, whose fore-arms were adorned with golden bracelets, the Yakshas,
with their bodies bent down, threw lotuses and bore up his hoofs as he rushed in startled
haste.

82. The city-roads which were closed with heavy gates and bars, and which could be with difficulty
opened even by elephants, flew open of their own accord without noise, as the prince
went through.

83. Firm in his resolve and leaving behind without hesitation his father who turned ever towards
him, and his young son, his affectionate people and his unparalleled magnificence, he
then went forth out of his father’s city.

84. Then he with his eyes long and like a full-blown lotus, looking back on the city, uttered
a sound like a lion, ‘Till I have seen the further shore of birth and death I will never
again enter the city called after Kapila.’

85. Having heard this his utterance, the troops of the court of the Lord of wealth rejoiced;
and the hosts of the gods, triumphing, wished him a successful accomplishment of his purpose.

86. Other heavenly beings with forms bright like fire, knowing that his purpose was hard to
fulfil, produced a light on his dewy path like the rays of the moon issuing from the rift
of a cloud.

87. But he with his horse like the horse of Indra, the lord of bay horses, hurrying on as if
spurred in his mind, went over the leagues full of many conflicting emotions,--the sky all
the while with its cloud-masses checkered with the light of the dawn.
