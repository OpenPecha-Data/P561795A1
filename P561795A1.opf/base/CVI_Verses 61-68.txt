61. ‘Thy red garments are auspicious, the sign of a saint; but this destructive bow is not befitting;
therefore, my good friend, if there is no strong preference in the matter, do thou
give me that dress and take this of mine.’

62. The hunter replied, ‘It has given me my desire, O giver of desires, as by this I have inspired
animals with confidence and then killed them; but if thou hast need of it, O thou who
art like Indra, accept it at once and give me the white dress.’

63. With extreme joy he then took that sylvan dress and gave away the linen one; and the hunter,
assuming his heavenly form, having taken the white garment, went to heaven.

64. Then the prince and the attendant of the horse were filled with wonder as he was thus going,
and forthwith they paid great honour anew to that sylvan dress.

65. Then the great-souled one, having dismissed the weeping Chanda, and wearing his fame veiled
by the sign of the red garment, went towards the hermitage, like the king of mountains
wrapped in an evening cloud.

66. While his master, thus regardless of his kingdom, was going to the ascetic-wood in mean
garments, the groom, tossing up his arms, wailed bitterly and fell on the ground.

67. Having looked again he wept aloud, and embraced the horse Kanthaka with his arms; and then,
hopeless and repeatedly lamenting, he went in body to the city, not in soul.

68. Sometimes he pondered, sometimes he lamented, sometimes he stumbled, and sometimes he fell;
and so going along, wretched through his devoted attachment, he performed all kinds of
actions in the road without conscious will.
