and endearments all fruitless, concealing their love deep in their hearts, returned to
the city with broken hopes.

not lie down all that night, like an elephant with an arrow in its heart; but wearied in all
sorts of consultation, he and his ministers could find no other means beside these (despised)
pleasures to restrain his sonâ€™s purpose.
