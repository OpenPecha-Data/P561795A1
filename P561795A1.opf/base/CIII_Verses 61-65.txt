61. ‘Is this end appointed to all creatures, and yet the world throws off all fear and is infatuated!
Hard indeed, I think, must the hearts of men be, who can be self-composed in such
a road.

62. ‘Therefore, O charioteer, turn back our chariot, this is no time or place for a pleasure-excursion;
how can a rational being, who knows what destruction is, stay heedless here, in
the hour of calamity?’

63. Even when the prince thus spoke to him, the charioteer did not turn the chariot back; but
at his peremptorily reiterated command he retired to the forest Padmakhanḍa.

64. There he beheld that lovely forest like Nandana itself, full of young trees in flower with
intoxicated kokilas wandering joyously about, and with its bright lakes gay with lotuses
and well-furnished with watering-places.

65. The king’s son was perforce carried away to that wood filled with troops of beautiful women,
just as if some devotee who had newly taken his vow were carried off, feeling weak to
withstand temptation, to the palace of the monarch of Alakâ, gay with the dancing of the
loveliest heavenly nymphs.
