81. Thus the king, in his grief for his separation from his son,--losing all his innate firmness
which was stedfast like the earth,--loudly lamented as one distraught, like Dasaratha,
a prey to his sorrow for Râma.

82. Then the wise counsellor, endued with religious learning, courtesy, and virtue, and the
old family priest, spoke to him as was befitting in these well-weighed words, neither with
their faces overwhelmed by grief nor yet wholly unmoved:

83. ‘Cease, O noblest of men, thy grief, regain thy firmness,--surely thou wilt not, O firm
hero, shed tears like one of no self-control; many kings on this earth have gone into the
forests, throwing away their royal pomp like a crushed wreath.

84. ‘Moreover, this his state of mind was all predetermined; remember those words long ago of
the holy sage Asita; "He will never be made to dwell even for a moment contentedly in heaven
or in an emperor’s domain."

85. ‘But if, O best of men, the effort must be made, quickly speak the word, we two will at
once go together; let the battle be waged in every way with thy son and his fate whatever
it be.’

86. Then the king commanded them both, ‘Do you both go quickly hence,--my heart will not return
to quiet, any more than a bird’s in the woods longing for its young.’

87. With a prompt acquiescence at the king’s order the counsellor and the family priest went
to that forest; and then with his wives and his queen the king also, saying, ‘It is done,’
performed the remainder of the rites.
